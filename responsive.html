      <h1>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF THE QUEEN</h1>
      Elizabeth II, in full Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, officially Elizabeth II,
      by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
      Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the
      Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, (born April 21, 1926, London,
      England—died September 8, 2022, Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire, Scotland),
      queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from
      February 6, 1952, to September 8, 2022. In 2015 she surpassed Victoria to
      become the longest-reigning monarch in British history. Early life Queen
      Elizabeth, King George VI, Princess Margaret, and Princess Elizabeth Queen
      Elizabeth, King George VI, Princess Margaret, and Princess Elizabeth
      Princess Elizabeth Princess Elizabeth Elizabeth was the elder daughter of
      Prince Albert, duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. As
      the child of a younger son of King George V, the young Elizabeth had
      little prospect of acceding to the throne until her uncle, Edward VIII
      (afterward duke of Windsor), abdicated in her father’s favour on December
      11, 1936, at which time her father became King George VI and she became
      heir presumptive. The princess’s education was supervised by her mother,
      who entrusted her daughters to a governess, Marion Crawford; the princess
      was also grounded in history by C.H.K. Marten, afterward provost of Eton
      College, and had instruction from visiting teachers in music and
      languages. During World War II she and her sister, Princess Margaret Rose,
      perforce spent much of their time safely away from the London blitz and
      separated from their parents, living mostly at Balmoral Castle in Scotland
      and at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, and Windsor Castle. Britain's Queen

      of Edinburgh Philip, duke of Edinburgh Early in 1947 Princess Elizabeth
      went with the king and queen to South Africa. After her return there was
      an announcement of her betrothal to her distant cousin Lieutenant Philip
      Mountbatten of the Royal Navy, formerly Prince Philip of Greece and
      Denmark. The marriage took place in Westminster Abbey on November 20,
      1947. On the eve of the wedding her father, the king, conferred upon the
      bridegroom the titles of duke of Edinburgh, earl of Merioneth, and Baron
      Greenwich. They took residence at Clarence House in London. Their first
      child, Prince Charles (Charles Philip Arthur George), was born November
      14, 1948, at Buckingham Palace. Accession to the throne Elizabeth II:

      Elizabeth II: Christmas broadcast In the summer of 1951 the health of King
      George VI entered into a serious decline, and Princess Elizabeth
      represented him at the Trooping the Colour and on various other state
      occasions. On October 7 she and her husband set out on a highly successful
      tour of Canada and Washington, D.C. After Christmas in England she and the
      duke set out in January 1952 for a tour of Australia and New Zealand, but
      en route, at Sagana, Kenya, news reached them of the king’s death on
      February 6, 1952. Elizabeth, now queen, at once flew back to England. The
      first three months of her reign, the period of full mourning for her
      father, were passed in comparative seclusion. But in the summer, after she
      had moved from Clarence House to Buckingham Palace, she undertook the
      routine duties of the sovereign and carried out her first state opening of
      Parliament on November 4, 1952. Her coronation was held at Westminster
      Abbey on June 2, 1953. Elizabeth II: royal tour of New Zealand Elizabeth
      II: royal tour of New Zealand Beginning in November 1953 the queen and the
      duke of Edinburgh made a six-month round-the-world tour of the
      Commonwealth, which included the first visit to Australia and New Zealand
      by a reigning British monarch. In 1957, after state visits to various
      European nations, she and the duke visited Canada and the United States.
      In 1961 she made the first royal British tour of the Indian subcontinent
      in 50 years, and she was also the first reigning British monarch to visit
      South America (in 1968) and the Persian Gulf countries (in 1979). During
      her “Silver Jubilee” in 1977, she presided at a London banquet attended by
      the leaders of the 36 members of the Commonwealth, traveled all over
      Britain and Northern Ireland, and toured overseas in the South Pacific and
      Australia, in Canada, and in the Caribbean. Elizabeth II: family Elizabeth

      Queen Elizabeth, her son Prince Charles became heir apparent; he was named
      prince of Wales on July 26, 1958, and was so invested on July 1, 1969. The
      queen’s other children were Princess Anne (Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise),
      born August 15, 1950, and created princess royal in 1987; Prince Andrew
      (Andrew Albert Christian Edward), born February 19, 1960, and created duke
      of York in 1986; and Prince Edward (Edward Anthony Richard Louis), born
      March 10, 1964, and created earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn in 1999.
      All these children have the surname “of Windsor,” but in 1960 Elizabeth
      decided to create the hyphenated name Mountbatten-Windsor for other
      descendants not styled prince or princess and royal highness. Elizabeth’s
      first grandchild (Princess Anne’s son) was born on November 15, 1977.

      <h1>HER SERVICES TO THE BRITISH NATION</h1>
      Many veterans have been paying their respects to Queen Elizabeth II at her
      lying in state. As sovereign she was head of the armed forces, but her
      association with the military began much earlier, in wartime. Princess
      Elizabeth was 13 when World War Two broke out. Those six years of conflict
      would see her begin in earnest her public role as the heir to the throne.
      It would be a defining period in the life of the future Queen, and at her
      death she was the last surviving head of state to have served in the war.
      At the outbreak of war against Germany in 1939, the Royal Family - parents
      King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and sister Princess Margaret - was
      seen as a potent symbol of the values for which Britain and its allies
      were fighting. In October 1940, as Britain was suffering the worst of the
      Blitz, Elizabeth made her first broadcast. It was billed as a message to
      children who had been sent to North America to escape the bombing of
      British cities. Image caption, The future Queen's first public address was
      a wartime broadcast made on BBC Children's Hour "We children at home are
      full of cheerfulness and courage," she said. "We are trying to do all we
      can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen. And we are trying
      too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war." The princess
      and her sister were some of the strongest propaganda weapons the
      government of the day had, says Prof Kate Williams, author of the
      biography Young Elizabeth. "It really was the Queen's first bombshell
      broadcast," she says. The very fact that Elizabeth and Margaret, who died
      in 2002, remained in the country was a significant morale-booster. There
      were suggestions the Royal Family itself should seek safety abroad,
      specifically in Canada, but the King and Queen would have none of it. "The
      children will not leave unless I do," declared Queen Elizabeth, later the
      Queen Mother. "I shall not leave unless their father does, and the King
      will not leave the country in any circumstances whatever." The furthest
      the children were ever moved was to Windsor Castle, about 30 miles from
      London. "We went for a weekend and stayed five years," they said. IMAGE
      SOURCE,PA Image caption, Princess Elizabeth, second from right, with her
      family in 1942. They remained in Britain during the war They were near
      enough, though, to see the fire-lit skies over London during the heavy
      bombing. On one occasion, a bomb landed close to the castle as they sat in
      the air-raid shelter. "We all went pink when we heard it," Princess
      Margaret later recalled. The sisters were joined on most evenings and at
      weekends by their parents, and lessons continued with their private
      tutors. At Christmas, in order to cheer up their father - who became
      depressed at the losses being inflicted on his countrymen and women - the
      girls performed pantomimes. It was Cinderella one year, Aladdin the next,
      with the princesses always in the starring roles. In 1944, with the King
      particularly upset at the setback of the Battle of Arnhem, the 18-year-old
      Elizabeth and 14-year-old Margaret wrote their own pantomime - Little Red
      Riding Boots - with the help of their mother. Three Guardsmen on duty at
      the castle were drafted in as extras. One of them, Bill Davies, later
      remembered being measured up and kitted out with scarlet tunics and
      bearskins. "The performance went off splendidly and the family were in
      stitches," he recalled. "It was a fairy tale moment. We forgot the war for
      an hour or two." The overriding sense of duty that marked her reign was
      forged in the drama of these years. In 1942, Princess Elizabeth carried
      out her first public engagement, inspecting a parade of the Grenadier
      Guards, to whom she had become honorary colonel. In the final year of the
      war, she donned a uniform herself, joining the Auxiliary Territorial
      Service - the ATS. She was registered as number 230873, Second Subaltern
      Elizabeth Windsor, and she spent three weeks with a carefully chosen group
      of other recruits, learning about basic motor mechanics and how to drive a
      lorry. It was said to have been the first time a female member of the
      Royal Family had ever attended a course with "other people". IMAGE
      SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Elizabeth served for a short period in
      uniform Now in her late 90s, Gwen Evans trained alongside the future Queen
      in the ATS, and remembers Princess Elizabeth receiving much the same
      treatment as everyone else. "The only difference was when we finished work
      at five o'clock we went back to our barracks, whereas Elizabeth was picked
      up and taken to Windsor Castle," she says. In May 1945, tens of thousands
      gathered outside Buckingham Palace to celebrate Victory in Europe Day.
      Winston Churchill joined the Royal Family on the balcony, and later, the
      two princesses slipped out to join the crowds. "I remember lines of
      unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall. All of us just
      swept along in a tide of happiness and relief," the Queen recalled 40
      years later. "After crossing Green Park, we stood outside and shouted, 'We
      want the King.' I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my
      life."
